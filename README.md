# Cyphon

A simple yet powerful Low Bandwidth DoS (Denial of Service) tool written for Mac OS X (Friendly GUI) based on RSnake's Slow Loris.

You can use this tool to test for DoS vulnerabilities on your server or to experiment it's potential. 


# Code Example

Cyphon is built in Xcode as a Cocoa-Applescript application. 

# Motivation

I decided to code an executable OSX version for Mac OS users as there are little server load testers out there for Mac OS.

SlowLoris seemed to be the best solution for a Mac DoS tool due to its ability of being a low bandwidth yet poisonous HTTP client by using a single IP address to send several partial HTTP requests.
